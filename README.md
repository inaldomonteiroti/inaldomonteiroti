Developing solutions for companies on the Internet has always been the focus of my work. During this process, I specialized in Software Engineering. I believe that it is my responsibility as an IT professional to promote original ideas and be a creative resource for companies and their professionals. I am a persistent, involved and curious person who values ​​work, family and responsibility.

I build scalable systems that don’t just work — they last.

As a Senior Full Stack Engineer, I bring over a decade of experience delivering real-world impact at companies, where I led remote engineering initiatives across eCommerce, fintech, and enterprise platforms. I’ve architected cloud-native SaaS platforms, shipped lightning-fast applications, and built infrastructure that scales effortlessly — while mentoring teams and collaborating across time zones. From backend systems to polished UIs, I move fast without breaking things. I thrive in async, remote-first environments and lead with clarity, ownership, and a deep understanding of how to turn product goals into robust software.

Stacks:

− Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Python, Node.js, PHP

− Frontend Engineering: React, Next.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Svelte, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Zustand, Pinia, Jquery

− API & System Architecture: REST, GraphQL, Microservices, Event-Driven Design, Kafka, RabbitMQ

− Backend Technologies: Express.js, NestJS, Django, FastAPI, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Laravel, Wordpress

− Databases & Caching: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

− Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure: AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS, EC2), GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

− DevOps & Test Automation: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, TDD, Jest, Cypress, OAuth 2.0, JWT

− Collaboration & Delivery: Agile, Scrum, Jira, Notion, Mentorship, Code Reviews, Stakeholder Communication
