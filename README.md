Developing solutions for companies on the Internet has always been the focus of my work. During this process, I specialized in Software Engineering. I believe that it is my responsibility as an IT professional to promote original ideas and be a creative resource for companies and their professionals. I am a persistent, involved and curious person who values â€‹â€‹work, family and responsibility.

I build scalable systems that donâ€™t just work â€” they last.

As a Senior Full Stack Engineer, I bring over a decade of experience delivering real-world impact at companies, where I led remote engineering initiatives across eCommerce, fintech, and enterprise platforms. Iâ€™ve architected cloud-native SaaS platforms, shipped lightning-fast applications, and built infrastructure that scales effortlessly â€” while mentoring teams and collaborating across time zones. From backend systems to polished UIs, I move fast without breaking things. I thrive in async, remote-first environments and lead with clarity, ownership, and a deep understanding of how to turn product goals into robust software.

âˆ’ Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Python, Node.js, PHP
